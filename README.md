# CSS calc() Function Unexpected Results

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the CSS `calc()` function: unexpected results or errors due to unit incompatibility, improper nesting, or missing spacing. 

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.css` file presents a corrected version.

The issue stems from the potential for errors when combining different units (e.g., pixels and percentages) without considering context, and not adhering to correct syntax.

This example serves as a reminder to carefully check units and syntax when using `calc()` to avoid unexpected behavior.
