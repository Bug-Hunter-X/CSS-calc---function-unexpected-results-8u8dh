The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can sometimes lead to unexpected results if not used correctly.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` might not produce the expected result if the parent element's width is not explicitly set.  Another common issue is unit incompatibility within the `calc()` function; mixing percentages and pixels without careful consideration of context can also yield unexpected results.  Finally, improperly nested `calc()` expressions,  or missing spaces between operators and operands can lead to parsing errors.
